    "### Building Your First LangGraph Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on tutorial where you'll build a basic chatbot using LangGraph! This tutorial is based on the [official LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/1-build-basic-chatbot/) and is designed to give you a solid foundation in LangGraph concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand what LangGraph is and why it's useful\n",
    "- ✅ Know how to create and structure a StateGraph\n",
    "- ✅ Learn about nodes, edges, and state management\n",
    "- ✅ Build a functional chatbot from scratch\n",
    "- ✅ Understand the basic LangGraph workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a simple chatbot that:\n",
    "- Maintains conversation state\n",
    "- Responds to user messages using an LLM\n",
    "- Demonstrates core LangGraph concepts\n",
    "- Forms the foundation for more advanced features\n",
