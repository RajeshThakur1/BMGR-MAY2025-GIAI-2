    "2. **Schema Discovery** - Automatically discover and understand database structure\n",
    "3. **Query Context Builder** - Create context for better query generation\n",
    "4. **AI-Powered SQL Generation** - Use LLM to convert natural language to SQL\n",
    "5. **Query Validation** - Validate and optimize generated queries\n",
    "6. **Interactive Interface** - Create a user-friendly interface\n",

    "- Use appropriate WHERE clauses for filtering\n",
    "- Use GROUP BY and aggregation functions when needed\n",

    "- For aggregations: SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNCTION(column) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name\n",
